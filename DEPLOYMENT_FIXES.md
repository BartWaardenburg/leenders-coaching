# Deployment Fixes Summary

This document outlines the fixes made to resolve installation, building, and deployment issues for the Leenders Coaching project.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Vercel Configuration Issues

**Problem**: The root `vercel.json` was too generic and didn't properly handle the monorepo structure.

**Solution**:

- Updated root `vercel.json` to properly specify the build directory and routing
- Added proper monorepo configuration with builds and routes
- Ensured the Next.js app configuration is properly set

### 2. Environment Variables Documentation

**Problem**: No clear documentation of required environment variables.

**Solution**:

- Created `env.example` file with all required environment variables
- Documented each variable's purpose and format
- Added environment variable setup instructions to README

### 3. GitHub Actions Improvements

**Problem**: CI workflow could be more robust and lacked proper error handling.

**Solution**:

- Enhanced CI workflow with better step naming and error handling
- Added build artifact upload for debugging
- Improved caching configuration
- Added proper environment variable handling

### 4. Deployment Workflow

**Problem**: No automated deployment workflow for production.

**Solution**:

- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automatic deployments
- Added proper environment configuration for production
- Included Vercel deployment action

### 5. Documentation

**Problem**: Limited documentation for deployment and setup.

**Solution**:

- Created comprehensive `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide
- Updated `README.md` with clear setup instructions
- Added troubleshooting section
- Documented all available scripts and commands

## Files Created/Modified

- `packages/leenders-coaching-nl/vercel.json` - Enhanced configuration
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Improved CI workflow
- `README.md` - Updated with better documentation

## Required Environment Variables

For successful deployment, ensure these environment variables are set:

### Vercel Dashboard

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION`
- `SANITY_API_TOKEN`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

### GitHub Secrets (for automated deployment)

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- All environment variables listed above

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on push to main

### Option 2: GitHub Actions

1. Add required secrets to GitHub repository
2. Push to main branch to trigger automatic deployment
3. Monitor deployment in GitHub Actions tab

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

1. Install Vercel CLI
2. Run `vercel --prod` from project root

## Verification Steps

To verify the fixes work:

1. **Local Build**: `pnpm build` should complete successfully
2. **CI Pipeline**: GitHub Actions should pass all checks
3. **Deployment**: Automatic deployment should work on push to main
4. **Environment**: All environment variables should be properly loaded

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check Vercel build logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Node.js 20+ and pnpm 9.15.9+ are used
4. Check GitHub Actions logs for CI/CD issues
5. Verify Sanity project configuration

## Next Steps

1. Set up environment variables in Vercel dashboard
2. Configure GitHub secrets for automated deployment
3. Test deployment with a small change
4. Monitor build and deployment logs
5. Verify the live site functionality
